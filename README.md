This project was to review my react knowledge where I worked on different features of React.

However this is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

 
## Covered features inReact such as 

- using *ContextAPI, Refs, hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext* 

- using *LifeCycle hooks like getDerivedStateFromProps, componentDidUpdate, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidMount, constructor, render, componentDidUnmount* 

- using *PureComponent*

- using *HOC*

- using *ErrorBoundaries*

- using *setState, useState*

- making *state immutable*

- using *CSS Modules*
